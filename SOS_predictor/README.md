# Site of Sulphonation (SOS) Predictor
# 1. Introduction
Welcome to SOS Predictor, a powerful tool designed to predict the potential of a query molecule to be a substrate and identify sites of sulphonation (SOS) in potential substrates. Sulphonation is a crucial biological process involved in various metabolic pathways, and understanding the potential substrates and their reactive sites is essential in drug discovery, toxicology, and chemical biology.SOS Predictor leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to accurately predict sulphonation sites in molecules whether you are a researcher exploring the metabolic fate of a new drug candidate.

# Features
* Substrate Prediction: Determine whether a given molecule is likely to be a substrate for sulphonation.
* Site Identification: Identification of potential sites of sulphonation within the molecule.
* User-Friendly Interface: Easy installation and intuitive usage, making it accessible to both beginners and experts.
