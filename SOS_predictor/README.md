# Site of Sulphonation (SOS) Predictor
# 1. Introduction
Welcome to SOS Predictor, a powerful tool designed to predict the potential of a query molecule to be a substrate and identify sites of sulphonation (SOS) in potential substrates. Sulphonation is a crucial biological process involved in various metabolic pathways, and understanding the potential substrates and their reactive sites is essential in drug discovery, toxicology, and chemical biology.SOS Predictor leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to accurately predict sulphonation sites in molecules whether you are a researcher exploring the metabolic fate of a new drug candidate.

# Features
* Substrate Prediction: Determine whether a given molecule is likely to be a substrate for sulphonation.
* Site Identification: Identification of potential sites of sulphonation within the molecule.
* User-Friendly Interface: Easy installation and intuitive usage, making it accessible to both beginners and experts.

# 2. System Requirements
Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
OS: Linux
Python 3.6 or later
Git (for cloning the repository)
Dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file
To ensure the seamless operation of the SOS Predictor, it relies on several dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. Additionally, it is recommended to set up a Conda environment that accommodates various essential Python libraries. If you don't already have Conda installed, you can obtain it from the official website at https://www.anaconda.com/. Detailed instructions for the Conda installation are available on the website.

# 3. Installation
Follow these steps to install SOS Predictor:
1. Download the SOS_Predictor directory and extract the contents by executing the command "unzip SOS_Predictor.zip."
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command:
   cd SOS-Predictor
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install -r https://github.com/Dixit-s-lab/Phase-II-prediction/blob/main/SOS_predictor/requirements.txt
Alternatively, manually install each specified dependency. If opting for manual installation, ensure to update the path in the bashrc file accordingly.

# 4. Usage
Input
Prepare input data in the specified format. Refer to the documentation or example files for guidance on the required input parameters.

Running SOS Predictor
Execute the following command to run SOS Predictor:

bash
Copy code
python sos_predictor.py -i input_file.txt -o output_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to your input file and output_file.txt with the desired output file path.

Output
The tool will generate an output file containing the SOS prediction results based on the input parameters.
